# About

The Last Network is tower defense game about defending a core (The Last Exit Node) it has a lore behind its creation but lets leave that for you to figure out when playing the full game (at the moment no lore has been implemented but after the Minimum Viable Product has been released that will be added in a future update!
# Installation

at the moment the best way to install the game is to download godot, clone the project and open it with godot (then use godots play button)

once the game is developed more I plan on having beta builds which will be purely in source code and then after testing, the beta build will be merged with main and a downloadable .exe will be released! possibly along with other methods to install.

# Future

The future of The Last Network is not 100% defined I hope to add hints at lore/the games story aswell as polish it but I may take a break from the project after the Minimum viable product is released to start work on a new project before updating it.

Either way I have more planned after The minimum viable product but it may be only be implemented a month or two after, or maybe more im currently unsure as when or if it will be implemented

# RoadMap

this is a smaller version of the roadmap for the game including a little more of whats next and a little of what was just done
this might change things get removed other things get added etc

things with a ? are especially still in thinking (but even things without are not final)
